UltraRAG UI is not just a chat interface, it is a complete RAG development and debugging platform.

## Startup Command

Use the following command to start the UI service:

```bash
ultrarag show ui [OPTIONS]
```

### Common Options

- `--port <INTEGER>`: Specify service port, default is `5050`.
- `--host <TEXT>`: Specify binding address, default is `127.0.0.1`.
- `--admin`: Enable administrator mode. By default, the UI only displays the chat interface (Chat Only). After enabling this option, Pipeline Builder (visual orchestration), parameter configuration, and online Prompt editing functions will be unlocked. In addition, an AI assistant is built into the administrator interface to help you efficiently complete Pipeline configuration and debugging.

### Examples

**Start Admin Mode with Full Functions:**

```bash
ultrarag show ui --admin
```

**Start Chat Only Interface (Suitable for End Users):**

```bash
ultrarag show ui
```

After startup, access `http://127.0.0.1:5050` in your browser to enter the system.

## 1. Chat

Entering the system displays the chat page by default. You can directly select a compiled Pipeline to start a conversation.

<Tip>We provide deployment tutorials for several developed Pipelines in [Typical Scenarios](/pages/en/demo/llm). You can also customize Pipelines according to your needs.</Tip>

### Pipeline Switching

You can quickly switch between Pipelines with configured parameters through the dropdown menu in the upper left corner.

### Select Knowledge Base

Click the Knowledge Base icon to mount the constructed knowledge base, and you can perform document-based Q&A.

### Background Running

For time-consuming Pipelines such as Deep Research, background running mode is supported. After the task execution is completed, the results will be automatically loaded into the current chat window.

## 2. Knowledge Base
UltraRAG UI provides full-process knowledge base management functions, supporting file upload, chunking, and embedding management.

### Connect Vector Database

<Tip>Don't know how to deploy Milvus vector library? Please refer to [Deployment Guide](/pages/en/ui/prepare).</Tip>

Click Configure DB to establish a connection with the deployed Milvus vector library, and you can use the knowledge base function.

### Build Knowledge Base

Click New Collection to upload documents and create an exclusive knowledge base.

Click the Settings button to customize the slicing strategy (Chunk) and Embedding model parameters.

<Tip>Configuration is usually required for first-time use. If you want to achieve configuration-free deployment (users do not need to set manually), please modify relevant parameters in `examples/parameter/corpus_chunk_parameter.yaml` and `examples/parameter/milvus_index_parameter.yaml` in advance to skip the setting steps below.</Tip>

## 3. Pipeline Builder
If the `--admin` parameter is specified at startup, the sidebar will display the Settings entry. Click to enter the advanced configuration page.

### Visual Pipeline Construction

Supports bidirectional real-time synchronization between drag-and-drop orchestration on the left canvas and code editor on the right. You can build intuitively like building blocks, or fine-tune in the code editor.

### Configure Parameters

After clicking the Build button to parse the Pipeline, you can view and modify running parameters in the parameter panel.

### Prompt Management

Supports online creation, editing, and deletion of Prompts, and one-click application to the Pipeline.

### AI Assistant

The system has a built-in AI assistant that can assist you in building Pipelines, adjusting parameters, and writing Prompts.

<Tip>Before using this function for the first time, you need to click Settings to configure the API Key and related model parameters.</Tip>

**Usage Example: Optimize Prompt**

Suppose you have a basic Prompt and want to adjust it to a style suitable for the legal field:

1. Open the AI assistant and enter the original Prompt and modification requirements.

2. Click Apply, and the AI assistant will automatically generate optimized content and replace the original Prompt.
