UltraRAG provides two installation methods: local source code installation (recommended using `uv` for package management) and Docker container deployment.

## Source Code Installation

We strongly recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage the Python environment and dependencies, as it can greatly improve installation speed.

**Prepare Environment**

If you haven't installed uv yet, please execute:

```shell
## Direct install
pip install uv
## Download script
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Download Source Code**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/UltraRAG.git --depth 1
cd UltraRAG
```

**Install Dependencies**

Please choose a synchronization method according to your usage scenario:

- **Core Dependencies**: If you only need to run basic core functions, such as using only UltraRAG UI:
  ```shell
  uv sync
  ```

- **Full Installation**: If you want to fully experience UltraRAG's retrieval, generation, corpus processing, and evaluation functions, please run:
  ```shell
  uv sync --extra retriever --extra generation --extra corpus --extra evaluation
  ```
- **On-Demand Installation**: If you only need to run specific modules, retain the corresponding `--extra` as needed, for example:

  ```shell
  uv sync --extra retriever   # Retrieval module only
  uv sync --extra generation  # Generation module only
  ```

## Docker Container Deployment

If you don't want to configure a local Python environment, you can use Docker for a one-click start.

```shell
# 1. Download code
git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/UltraRAG.git --depth 1
cd UltraRAG
# 2. Build image
docker build -t ultrarag:latest .
# 3. Start container (port 5050 is automatically mapped)
docker run -it --gpus all -p 5050:5050 ultrarag:latest
```
Tip: The container will automatically run UltraRAG UI after startup. You can access `http://localhost:5050` directly in your browser.

## Verify Installation

After installation is complete, run the following example command to check if the environment is normal:

```shell
ultrarag run examples/sayhello.yaml
```

Seeing the following output indicates a successful installation:

```
Hello, UltraRAG v3!
```
