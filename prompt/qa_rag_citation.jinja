Please answer the user's question strictly based on the following reference documents.

Note: Each document passage is prefixed with an identifier such as “[1]”, “[2]”, “[3]”.  
These identifiers must be used exactly as citation IDs in your answer.  
Do NOT create new IDs, modify IDs, or cite content not present in the documents.

【Answering & Citation Rules】
1. Every factual statement must end with citation(s) using the corresponding document ID(s).  
   Example: “Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon[1].”
2. Citation format must strictly be `[id]` (square brackets only).  
   Incorrect: “(Doc 1)…”, “According to [1]…”
3. If multiple documents support a single statement, append citations consecutively, e.g. `[1][3][5]`.
4. Do not repeat or restate entire documents. Summaries must still obey citation rules.
