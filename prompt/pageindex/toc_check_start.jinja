You will be given the current section title and the current page_text.
Your job is to check if the current section starts in the beginning of the given page_text.
If there are other contents before the current section title, then the current section does not start in the beginning of the given page_text.
If the current section title is the first content in the given page_text, then the current section starts in the beginning of the page_text.

Note: do fuzzy matching, ignore any space inconsistency in the page_text.

The given section title is {{ title }}.
The given page_text is {{ page_text }}.

reply format:
{
    "thinking": <why do you think the section appears or starts in the page_text>
    "start_begin": "yes or no" (yes if the section starts in the beginning of the page_text, no otherwise)
}
